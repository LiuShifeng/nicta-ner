NICTA t3as Named-Entity Recognition web service
===============================================

DO NOT UPLOAD TEXT CONTAINING PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ABOUT ANY PERSON.
This information cannot be kept private in this website, and will potentially be available to third parties as
all text entered on this page is sent unencrypted in clear text to the service.
This demonstration service runs on a publicly accessible server that is not geographically constrained.


## Using the service

To use the service simply HTTP `POST` some `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoded `UTF-8` text to the service URL, usually (unless using a customised service):

    http://ner.t3as.org/nicta-ner-web/rest/v1.0/ner


## JSON response format

The service will respond with `application/json` content of the following format:

    {
        "phrases": [
            [
                {
