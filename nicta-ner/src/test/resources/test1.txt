I was born in the UK in the 60's, actually 1965.
My brother Eoghan used to own a Ford Escort. 
Now he owns a Toyota Camry which he bought at the end of Feb, on a Tues.
It had a CD player, with the license plate H123ABC.
He used to work for the Department of Health when I was small, but now he works for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
Students who came from China, America and Australia are here.
